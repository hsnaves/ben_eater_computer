# FPGA implementation of Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer

This is my humble attempt at implementing Ben Eater's 8-bit
breadboard computer in Verilog. For more details about the
design and physical hardware implementation of the computer,
please refer to the original Youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).

## Building the code

To build and simulate the computer using [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator),
just type:

```shell
make
```

To clean the repository, type
```shell
make clean
```

## Overview of the repository

- The directory `rtl` contains of the Verilog code for the computer,
which includes the cpu and the memory;
- The directory `data` contains the contents of the microcode rom
(generated by `generate_microcode.py`), the initial contents of the
ram (including a program to compute Fibonacci numbers), and the
contents of the rom for 7-segment display;
- The Verilator code can be found inside `sim`;
- Inside `board\numato_mimas_v2` there are some Verilog files that
can be used for generating the bistream for the Numato Mimas V2 board.
Among other things, this directory contains the Verilog code for
a 7-segment display, a manual clock driver (to throttle the
clock to a much smaller frequency, and to enable manual control
of the clock frequency);

Thank you Ben Eater for the awesome videos!!!
